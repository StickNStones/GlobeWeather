# GlobeWeather
Work in progress

Using https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-globe.gl for globe visualization
Using https://openweathermap.org/ api for data on cities

Started with Visual Studio's template for .NET and React projects. PostgreSQL used as database.

global-weather page features city input form as well as a rotating globe and table.

The rotating globe has the valid inputted cities of the day marked with extended points sized based on their temperature at the inputted time.
